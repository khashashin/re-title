# Re-Title

_Turn your chaotic tab bar into a clean, organized workspace_

## The Chrome Reality Check

Chrome extensions **cannot** modify the browser's native tab styling. This means:

- ‚ùå Can't change tab width or padding
- ‚ùå Can't make regular tabs look exactly like pinned tabs
- ‚ùå Can't access browser UI CSS
- ‚úÖ Can change tab titles (which is what this extension does)

## The Practical Solution

Since we can't change tab styling, here's the most effective workflow:

### For Your Core Tools (Pin These)

**Pin your most-used tabs** - these become true icon-only tabs:

- Gmail, Calendar, Slack
- GitHub, documentation sites
- Music/media players

Right-click ‚Üí "Pin tab" - these stay minimal and organized.

### For Project/Group Work (Use Re-Title)

**Use Re-Title with tab groups** for project-based browsing:

1. Create tab groups for different projects/contexts
2. Use Re-Title to set minimal titles (single characters or short names)
3. Get organized, less-cluttered tab groups

## Best Practices

### Pinned Tab Strategy:

- Pin 3-6 core tools you use daily
- These become your permanent dock
- Always visible, always minimal

### Tab Group Strategy:

- Group related project tabs
- Use Re-Title for minimal titles ("P1", "Docs", "‚Ä¢", etc.)
- Color-code groups for quick identification

### Title Options for Groups:

- Single characters: ‚Ä¢, ‚óØ, ‚ñ™, ‚Üí
- Short codes: P1, Dev, Ref
- Emoji: üìù, üîß, üìä
- Invisible character: ‚†Ä (still has padding but no visible text)

## Installation

## Contributing

Found a bug? Have ideas for making the icon-only workflow even better?

The codebase is intentionally minimal‚Äîthis tool does one thing well rather than trying to solve every browser problem. Keep that philosophy in mind for any contributions.
